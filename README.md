# Flight Control System

### Sky Pulse Drone - Flight Control System
The Flight Control System (FCS) of the Sky Pulse Drone is a critical component designed to optimize drone operation and flight performance. This system is responsible for real-time processing of flight data, controlling the drone's attitude and navigation, and ensuring flight stability and safety.

#### Features
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Receives and interprets sensor data (such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS, etc.) for real-time flight status monitoring.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Supports path planning and automated flight modes, intelligently adjusting flight trajectories based on predefined routes.
- **Stability Control**: Utilizes advanced control algorithms (such as PID control) to ensure stable flight in various environmental conditions.
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Includes fault detection, emergency landing procedures, and return-to-home functionality to enhance flight safety.

#### Tech Stack
- Programming Language: C/C++
- Operating Environment: Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) or specific embedded systems
- Communication Protocol: MAVLink (or other suitable protocols for drone communication)

#### Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sky-pulse-drone-flight-control.git
   ```
2. Compile and deploy it to the drone hardware platform.
3. Configure sensors and parameters to adjust settings for specific application scenarios.
